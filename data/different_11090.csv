Phoenix,Huh!?
Lana,"I confess to all charges against me. On February 21 of this year, I murdered Detective Bruce Goodman... in the underground parking lot of the Prosecutor's Office."
Phoenix,"No, Lana!"

Phoenix,(This can't be happening!)
Judge,It appears the time for the verdict has arrived. This court finds the defendant...

Edgeworth,"One moment, Your Honor."
Judge,M-Mr. Edgeworth!?
