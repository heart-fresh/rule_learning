Maya,"Yeah, hold on... Victim... victim... Here! Found it!"
Phoenix,"Gregory Edgeworth, 35, defense attorney. If he were still alive, he'd be 50. He had lost that day's case in court, and got in the elevator with his son, Miles."
Maya,"""Miles""...!"
Phoenix,"Miles Edgeworth, of course."
Maya,So he was on the elevator with his father!
Phoenix,"From the angle of the bullet and the other evidence, it could not have been a suicide... The murder weapon, a pistol, was found in the elevator. The pistol had been fired two times. (Where have I heard that before...? Huh...! It sounds just like this current case! What's going on here?)"
Phoenix,Got any data on the suspect in there?
Maya,Hmm... that would be the guy that my mom got arrested. Hold on... this is it.
Phoenix,"The man arrested as a suspect in DL-6 was... Yanni Yogi? He was a clerk in the court, apparently."
Maya,"So he must have been the third person in the elevator. Well, then he had to have done it!"
Phoenix,"But... he was found innocent. Thanks to his defense lawyer, Robert Hammond."
Maya,Hammond... the victim in our case!
Phoenix,"Right. The suspect, Mr. Yogi was oxygen deprived... so much so he had brain damage. He lost all memory of being in the elevator. After he was declared innocent, he disappeared."
Maya,"Hmm... where could Yogi have gone to, I wonder?"
Phoenix,(He may be closer than we think...)
Phoenix,I guess I know generally what happened in DL-6 now. I still don't know what sort of impact the whole thing had on Edgeworth...
Maya,Nick. Are we going to take the whole file? There's too much! We'll never get it out.
Phoenix,Y-you're right. How about we just take what we think we'll need...
Phoenix,"Right. That's probably all we'll be able to find here. Now, all that's left is the trial tomorrow... I wonder how ""Dad"" will do testifying in court..."
Judge,Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Miles Edgeworth.
Phoenix,"The defense is ready, Your Honor."
