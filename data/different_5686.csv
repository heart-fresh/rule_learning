Maya,Hammond... the victim in our case!
Phoenix,"Right. The suspect, Mr. Yogi was oxygen deprived... so much so he had brain damage. He lost all memory of being in the elevator. After he was declared innocent, he disappeared."
Maya,"Hmm... where could Yogi have gone to, I wonder?"
Phoenix,(He may be closer than we think...)
Phoenix,I guess I know generally what happened in DL-6 now. I still don't know what sort of impact the whole thing had on Edgeworth...
Maya,Nick. Are we going to take the whole file? There's too much! We'll never get it out.
Phoenix,Y-you're right. How about we just take what we think we'll need...
Phoenix,"Right. That's probably all we'll be able to find here. Now, all that's left is the trial tomorrow... I wonder how ""Dad"" will do testifying in court..."
Judge,Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Miles Edgeworth.

Judge,"Very well, apparently the prosecution is also ready."
Phoenix,"(Who is the judge here, anyway!?)"
Judge,"Mr. von Karma, your opening statement."
Karma,... ...
Judge,"Er... very well, no opening statement so..."

Karma,"Not so fast, Judge! I was taking a meaningful pause before speaking!"
Judge,"R-right, of course."
Karma,A prediction! Today's trial will end three minutes from now!
