Lana,"You knew whose fingerprints those were all along, yet you... you acted like she really didn't..."
Phoenix,Ms. Skye. It's not over yet...
Lana,What!?
Phoenix,I said this trial isn't over yet.
Gant,"Ha! But I'm afraid it is over, boy! Not only this trial... but your career too!"
Phoenix,...
Gant,"You purposely concealed this conclusive evidence. That, my friend, is a serious offense."

Gant,"What's the matter, cat got your tongue? Aren't you going to tell us how it feels? How it feels to be the one who single-handedly turned a poor little girl into a murderer!?"

Gant,Oh? And what's that?
Phoenix,Who really killed Prosecutor Neil Marshall.
Judge,What!?
Phoenix,"Chief Gant, you are absolutely right. This piece of cloth proves who the real murderer is. Who killed Neil Marshall, you ask?"
