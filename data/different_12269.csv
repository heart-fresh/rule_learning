Phoenix,I said this trial isn't over yet.
Gant,"Ha! But I'm afraid it is over, boy! Not only this trial... but your career too!"
Phoenix,...
Gant,"You purposely concealed this conclusive evidence. That, my friend, is a serious offense."
Phoenix,...
Gant,"I'm looking forward to pressing charges after the defendant is convicted. I'll have your badge, boy!"
Phoenix,...
Gant,"What's the matter, cat got your tongue? Aren't you going to tell us how it feels? How it feels to be the one who single-handedly turned a poor little girl into a murderer!?"
Phoenix,... Before I do that... there's just one little thing I have to clear up.
Gant,Oh? And what's that?
Phoenix,Who really killed Prosecutor Neil Marshall.
Judge,What!?
Phoenix,"Chief Gant, you are absolutely right. This piece of cloth proves who the real murderer is. Who killed Neil Marshall, you ask?"
Judge,"It was Ema Skye, wasn't it?"
Phoenix,"I'm afraid that's not possible. You see, this piece of cloth contains a critical contradiction!"
Gant,What!? A contradiction!? What is this fool babbling about!?
Phoenix,I'm talking about a contradiction. One that proves... who the real killer is!
Judge,M-Mr. Wright! This piece of cloth... What could it possibly contradict!?
Phoenix,"(Chief Gant, your tyrannical reign ends here!) Behold! The piece of evidence that contradicts this cloth!"

Gant,And what exactly is this supposed to be...?
