Judge,So... it seems all the questions raised in this trial have been answered.
Phoenix,"I'm sorry, Ms. Skye... I couldn't get you out of all your trouble."
Lana,"... My, my. What high standards you have... for a rookie."
Phoenix,...!
Lana,"I can see why Mia thought so highly of you. Who knows? A few years from now, you just might make it to the top. I owe you my thanks, Mr. Wright."
Phoenix,Ms. Skye...
Lana,"And to you too, Mr. Edgeworth."
Edgeworth,...!
Lana,"You've suffered every bit as much as I have over these past few days. Believe me, I know how much of an ordeal it's been for you."
Edgeworth,Hmph! It was nothing.
Phoenix,(Liar...)
Lana,"I was worried the pressure might break you. And yet... you rose above it all and guided Mr. Wright to victory. You've done well, Mr. Edgeworth."
Edgeworth,S-stop it! I only did my job!
Judge,In light of this case... It seems a good self-examining is in order for all of us. Ms. Skye.
Lana,"Yes, Your Honor?"
Judge,"You are innocent of murder. However... Although the Chief blackmailed you, the fact is you still acted as his accomplice. A trial will be scheduled for these crimes at a later date."
Lana,"Yes. I understand, Your Honor."
Judge,Is there something amusing about all of this? Why are you smiling?
Lana,"It's been a long time, Your Honor. A long time since I've felt free of these heavy chains..."
Judge,"Well, this trial has gone on far too long already. Regarding the charge of murder, this court finds the defendant, Ms. Lana Skye..."
Judge,Not Guilty
