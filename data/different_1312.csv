Phoenix,(15 years...!)
Grossberg,"All because of the ""DL-6 Incident,"" as you may have guessed."
Phoenix,(The name on the back of those photographs!)
Grossberg,"As you suspected, I could not stand in defense of Maya because of this. White would have destroyed me if I did."
Phoenix,(So that's the connection!)
Grossberg,"It is hard for me to tell you this, my boy. But arresting Redd White will be nigh on impossible."
Phoenix,Impossible? Why!?
Grossberg,"He has information on everyone. It gives him an iron grip! He owns judges, attorneys, prosecutors, police... and politicians."
Phoenix,What!?
Grossberg,"They are bound, unable to do harm to themselves, and therefore, to him. Don't look at me like that. What you see is nothing more than the weight of many years."
Phoenix,"What is the ""DL-6 Incident""?"
Grossberg,"""DL-6"" is nothing more than the sorting code the police gave the case. It was 15 years ago now... I received a request from a medium. A spirit medium."
Phoenix,(A medium...?)
Grossberg,Her name was Misty Fey.
Phoenix,(Fey!)
Grossberg,"Indeed. She was Mia's mother. She had been investigating a murder at the bequest of the police. And... she failed. As a result, the police called her a fraud."
Phoenix,(This is what Maya was talking about the other day!)
Grossberg,"I did all I could for her, and in the end, cleared her of wrongdoing. That murder case, however remains unsolved to this day. That case, is the DL-6 Incident."
Phoenix,"But why were you blackmailed over this, Mr. Grossberg?"
Grossberg,The DL-6 Incident was top-secret at the time. It made sense. The police didn't want people to know they were using a medium! They couldn't let people know. But one person found out. I... I told him.
Phoenix,You told White?
