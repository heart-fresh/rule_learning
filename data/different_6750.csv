Judge,Not Guilty
Judge,That is all. The court is adjourned!
Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Judge,"D-did someone just say ""objection""?"
Phoenix,"(It wasn't von Karma...! Wait, but that means...) No... Edgeworth!?"
Edgeworth,Your Honor. I object to your judgment.
Judge,Wh-what do you mean?
Edgeworth,"I'm not innocent at all! As we have heard, Yanni Yogi killed Robert Hammond in revenge. But, revenge for what?"
Maya,Nick! Edgeworth is trying to confess! He's going to say he's guilty! He's going to tell them he was the murderer in the DL-6 Incident! He's going to tell them he killed his own dad!
Phoenix,(Uh oh! What do I do?)

Phoenix,The judgment has already been passed! I object to Edgeworth's outburst...
Karma,Objection.gif
Karma,"Didn't something like this happen yesterday, too? I believe a certain witness raised an objection after a guilty verdict was passed."
Phoenix,(That would be Larry...)
Karma,We must hear this new statement! We must hear Miles Edgeworth!
Judge,He's right. We have a duty to hear Mr. Edgeworth out.
Edgeworth,"For fifteen years... I have had a recurring dream. A nightmare... it's only a nightmare. That's what I told myself. But now I know, it wasn't a dream. Yanni Yogi wasn't the killer."
Judge,You mean... in the incident where your father died?
Edgeworth,"From the distance of the shot, it wasn't suicide, either. Everything was as clear as day. The murderer... The criminal in the DL-6 Incident... It was me! Your Honor! I confess my guilt! I am guilty for DL-6, the statute of limitations of which ends today! The culprit... is me!"
Judge,"Order! Order! This is certainly unexpected! The defendant, declared innocent, is confessing to another crime! A crime for which the statute of limitations runs out today! I'm not really sure how I should deal with this..."
